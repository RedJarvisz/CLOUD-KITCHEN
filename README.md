# CLOUD-KITCHEN

**Project Overview: Cloud-Kitchen**

A Cloud-Kitchen is a cloud-based kitchen management platform designed to streamline food delivery operations. It uses microservices architecture and leverages AWS cloud services for scalability, automation, and monitoring.

**Step-by-Step Process**

**1. Define System Requirements and Architecture**

1.1 Core Functionalities

- Restaurant & Kitchen Management: Track orders, inventory, and kitchen workflow.
- Order Processing & Delivery: Manage orders from multiple platforms.
- Payment Integration: Secure payment handling with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- Inventory Management: Monitor stock levels using AWS DynamoDB/RDS.
- User Authentication: Secure login via AWS Cognito or custom authentication.
- Monitoring & Logging: Use AWS CloudWatch for performance tracking.

1.2 Tech Stack & AWS Services

- Compute: EC2 (for backend services), Lambda (for serverless processing).
- Storage: S3 (for storing images, menus, invoices), EBS (for EC2 storage).
- Database: RDS (for structured data like orders, users, transactions).
- API Management: API Gateway (for REST APIs).
- Monitoring: CloudWatch (for logs, alerts, and system health monitoring).
- Security: IAM (for access control), AWS Cognito (optional for authentication).

**2. Setting Up AWS Infrastructure**
   
2.1 Deploying the Backend on AWS EC2

   1. Create an EC2 Instance
     - Choose Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu.
     - Attach an Elastic IP.
     - Configure IAM roles for EC2 access to S3, RDS, and CloudWatch.

   2. Set Up Web Server & Backend
     - Install Node.js/Express.js or Django/Flask (for API development).
     - Install necessary libraries (npm install or pip install).
     - Enable ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

   3. Connect Backend to Amazon RDS
     - Create an RDS instance (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
     - Configure security groups to allow EC2 access.
     - Store database credentials securely in AWS Secrets Manager.

   4. Store Assets in S3
     - Create an S3 bucket to store menus, images, invoices.
     - Set up IAM policies for secure access.


**3. API Development & Integration**

3.1 Developing APIs with API Gateway & Lambda

   - Create API Gateway Endpoints (e.g., /orders, /inventory, /payments).
   - Connect API Gateway to AWS Lambda for serverless execution.
   - Write Lambda functions in Node.js or Python to handle order processing.
   Example API:
```
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const orderData = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const response = { statusCode: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Order received" }) };
    return response;
};
```

3.2 Implementing Authentication & Security

   - Use JWT-based authentication or AWS Cognito.
   - Restrict API access using IAM roles & API Gateway policies.


**4. Deploying and Scaling the Application**

4.1 Automating Deployment with CI/CD

   - Set up CodePipeline for automated deployment.
   - Integrate GitHub/GitLab for version control.
   - Use Docker to containerize the backend and deploy on EC2.

4.2 Monitoring & Logging with CloudWatch

   - Enable CloudWatch Logs for API requests, Lambda executions.
   - Set up CloudWatch Alarms for performance issues.
   - Use AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing of microservices.


**5. Final Testing & Optimization**

   - Load Testing: Use JMeter to simulate multiple orders.
   - Security Audits: Check for vulnerabilities in APIs.
   - Performance Optimization: Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) for EC2.


**6. Deployment & Maintenance**

   - Deploy backend via EC2 Auto Scaling or Fargate (for serverless containers).
   - Use Amazon Route 53 for custom domain & SSL certificate.
   - Regularly update dependencies & security patches.


Conclusion

This Cloud-Kitchen project provides a scalable, automated platform for managing food delivery operations using AWS microservices. It ensures high availability, security, and efficiency through EC2, API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, and CloudWatch.
