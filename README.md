# CLOUD-KITCHEN

**Project Overview: Cloud-Kitchen**

A Cloud-Kitchen is a cloud-based kitchen management platform designed to streamline food delivery operations. It uses microservices architecture and leverages AWS cloud services for scalability, automation, and monitoring.

##**Step-by-Step Process**

1. Define System Requirements and Architecture

1.1 Core Functionalities

- Restaurant & Kitchen Management: Track orders, inventory, and kitchen workflow.
- Order Processing & Delivery: Manage orders from multiple platforms.
- Payment Integration: Secure payment handling with AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
- Inventory Management: Monitor stock levels using AWS DynamoDB/RDS.
- User Authentication: Secure login via AWS Cognito or custom authentication.
- Monitoring & Logging: Use AWS CloudWatch for performance tracking.

1.2 Tech Stack & AWS Services

- Compute: EC2 (for backend services), Lambda (for serverless processing).
- Storage: S3 (for storing images, menus, invoices), EBS (for EC2 storage).
- Database: RDS (for structured data like orders, users, transactions).
- API Management: API Gateway (for REST APIs).
- Monitoring: CloudWatch (for logs, alerts, and system health monitoring).
- Security: IAM (for access control), AWS Cognito (optional for authentication).
